# Standards Impact on Decentralized Identity

The decentralized identity system is a composite of many standards and common conventions. The system would benefit by shared, reliable implementation across organizations, and could become a standard itself in the long-term.

## Standards & Common Conventions in Use

- RFC 5785 Well-Known URIs
- Schema.org data objects
- JSON API RESTful request/response format (needs review)

## Needs

- Authentication scheme for challenge response (FIDO, Web Auth?)
- Signed attestation format (JWT?)
- Query filter DSL
